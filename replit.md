## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built using React 18 with TypeScript, utilizing a modern component-based architecture. The application leverages Vite as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds. The UI is constructed using shadcn/ui components, providing a consistent design system built on top of Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS.

**Component Structure:**
- **Landing Page Components**: Modular sections including Hero, Services, Process, Testimonials, Contact, and Footer components
- **UI Component Library**: Comprehensive set of reusable components (buttons, cards, forms, navigation, etc.) following shadcn/ui conventions
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints and adaptive layouts
- **State Management**: React Query for server state management and form handling

**Routing and Navigation:**
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- Single-page application with smooth scrolling navigation to page sections
- 404 error handling for undefined routes

### Backend Architecture
The backend is built with Express.js and TypeScript, following a clean separation of concerns with modular route handling and storage abstraction.

**API Design:**
- RESTful API endpoints for contact form submissions
- Express middleware for request logging, JSON parsing, and error handling
- Centralized error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

**Storage Layer:**
- Abstracted storage interface (IStorage) allowing for multiple implementations
- Currently implements in-memory storage for development
- Prepared for database integration with Drizzle ORM schema definitions
- PostgreSQL schema defined for users and contact submissions

**Development Environment:**
- Vite integration for hot module replacement in development
- Development-specific middleware and error overlays
- Replit-specific optimizations and banner integration

### Data Storage Solutions
The application uses a hybrid approach to data persistence, designed for easy transition from development to production.

**Database Schema (Drizzle ORM):**
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Contact submissions table with fields for name, email, company, message, and timestamps
- User management table for potential authentication features
- UUID-based primary keys with automatic generation

**Development Storage:**
- In-memory storage implementation for rapid development and testing
- Maintains data consistency during development sessions
- Easy migration path to persistent database storage

### Authentication and Authorization
The application currently implements a basic user schema foundation for future authentication needs. The architecture is prepared for session-based authentication with proper user management, though not currently active in the lead generation landing page flow.
